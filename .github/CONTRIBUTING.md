## Ways on contributing
### Bug Reports
If you find a bug report, please report it in the **issues** section in this repository labeled `bug`.

Before you go on a rampage on bug reporting, please follow our guidelines before doing so:

- Be clear and concise with the title, it will help others link their issues and solutions to yours.
- Specify the ways to reproduce the bug, so our development team and contributors can reproduce by themselves.
- Show the output, using logs and screenshots, to help others understand your issue.
- If you're running a self-hosted version of **Arisu**, specify the specs you're running, distribution (locally, Docker), and the version and git commit hash before you report the bug.
- If you're bumping to performance issues, you can run the **profiler** in an isolated environment or in your environment and report the results or you can use the Node.js [profiler diagnostic](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/simple-profiling/) and report the results.

### Security Issues
If you find a security issue, please contact us at **security@arisu.land** and we will work with you to report the issue.
